# CS_GO-Gamers-Performance-Analysis

Introduction
Teaming up with the right people is the key to winning and ranking up in
competitive e-sports. Professional team member recruitment in CSGO has a very similar dynamic as the
job market in our real world where more skilled players are generally more valuable and attractive to team
owners. However, a rule on the DreamTeam platform that each play can only belongs to one team at any
point of time and the norm that free players tend to join the strongest team available, have led to a very
competitive market for team recruitment.
For some team owners who just started forming a team, it would be hard for them to recruit the
very best experienced players with high ranks. Therefore, their next best option is to recruit the less
experienced from lower ranks who have great potential to rank up quickly. Although the ranking system in
CSGO would mainly reflect the players’ performance in the game, there are still other non-performance
related rules governing a player’s value.
In this paper, I created an algorithm to identify high potential talents who are being undervalued by
the games ranking system on early stage, so that professional team owners can target these players and
have a better chance to get the matching talents before they are taken. This can also be used to check new
players’ potential ranking who have not collected 10 wins to get their first placement.
